## Purpose:
Overall App:
A safe space for women software engineers to come together and freely share their code snippets, experience thus far, any struggles and wins, and other lifestyle adjustments that have arisen through becoming a developer!

Models:
#1 The first model is a standard blog post and its functionality is for the user to input a username, image, and a description box for the featured text of the post.
#2 The second model is specific for code blog posts. The user can add a username and a code snippet.


### Approach & Team Best Practices :
Every at 10am our team met to discuss responsibilities for each team member, the progress of the project, challenges we faced, and project goals. Throughout the day each team member was available on slack in case another team member needed support/help debugging. If the project plan needed to be restructured it was discussed with the whole team before executing major changes.
